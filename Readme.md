# At what size of a project should you start using version management software?

Any size of project can be used with version management software. The idea of version control software is for a progammer to keep track of they're code 
changes for future reference. What ever size project a programmer may be working on, version control software is useful for keeping track of those changes. 
With large projects, version control software becomes more important because of the amount of changes that occur and the number of progammers working on 
that particular project. A project may have several progammers
working or collaborating on the same or different parts of a project so version control software can help not only with keeping track of changes but it can give programmers
insight as to what changes to the project may happen in the future and how to make the code line for efficient.
